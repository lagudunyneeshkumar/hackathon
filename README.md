Agriculture Metrics and residue management

  There are certain influencing variables that helped farmers during the cultivation phase. 
  The farmer needs to be aware of all the information that they need. Any other source, including the government, could be the source.
  It should be simple to access this information, but the government has not done a good job of organizing it, employing many websites to display various information, which is burdensome for the farmers. 
  Additionally, farmers today were unaware of how to manage and profit from agricultural waste. 
  The primary risk of burning agricultural waste is pollution, which farmers in North India have been blamed for creating. 
  About 15–20 million tones of crop residue are produced annually. In this case, a practical way to safely dispose of this garbage is urgently required. 
  Due to this necessity, innovators are working on technology to deal with agricultural waste in a more sustainable way. 
  They also hope to provide farmers with financial incentives to sell their crop waste, which may persuade them to stop burning stubble. 
  However, there are numerous uses for this agricultural waste, some of which the farmer might utilize to supplement his or her income. 
  We can employ waste to create biodegradable plates, and textiles, and lastly, many residues can be used as fossil fuel substitutes 
  
  
  stacks used:
  
   We use HTML,CSS and javascript to create
   •We used PHP and my sql database to store the farmer's responses
   • Google Maps API  


*note:Due to the static view of website ,to use the php we need to have local server (xampp),so we didnot include the backend file*
